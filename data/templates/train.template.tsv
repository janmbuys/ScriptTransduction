mix butter pressed garlic chives salt pepper and cooking sherry .	make sure to wash your hands first as you will be using your fingers and you do n't want to spread any germs . you will be using softened butter , garlic , chives , salt , white pepper , and a garlic press . white pepper is stronger than black pepper , so measure this out carefully . white pepper will not show up as much either . use a fork to mesh up the butter in the medium size bowl before adding any additional ingredients , until it is mushy . place the softened butter in the bowl , and mash the three garlic cloves in your garlic press , one clove at a time . you will place a clove of garlic that has been peeled in the press , squeeze , and then using your fork , scrap off the garlic paste that oozes out of the device . you are really getting the juice out of the clove , which is different than if you chopped it . mix in the chives , about one to one and a half tablespoons of chopped chives . add a small amount of salt . using your fork , continue to mix and press all the ingredients until smooth and well mixed . next , you will need to slowly add cooking sherry , an inexpensive sherry from the grocery store is sufficient to give a good flavor . start with a small amount , about 1 tablespoon , and only add if more sherry s need . this will be used for the twelve mussels , but could be used on top of chicken , fish , and steak to make a tasty dish and marry the flavors .	1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1
